# Log — Nusantara Realm

## 2026-06-14 — Save persistence (roadmap #6)
- Refresh used to wipe your whole party — the biggest gap now that taming, XP,
  bond and HP have real depth. Now progress survives a reload.
- Wrapped the zustand store in `persist` middleware (key `nusantara-realm-save`).
  `partialize` persists only `party` + `tamedWildIds`; transient state (mode,
  battle, nearby/taming targets, message) is excluded so a reload always lands
  in 'explore' with no stale battle. `onRehydrateStorage` resumes `uidCounter`
  past the highest restored uid so new tames can't collide.
- tsc clean; console clean. Verified in browser: tamed a Kancil → save written
  (party 1) → page reload → party + tamedWildIds restored intact (kancil hp 26,
  wild-kancil-1 still removed) → a fresh tame got uid m2 (no collision). Core
  tame loop intact. Pushed to main.

## 2026-06-14 — Tree collision (roadmap #4 world richness)
- Player walked through trees, breaking the solid-world feel. Now you can't.
- Extracted the deterministic scenery layout (mulberry32 seed 1337) out of
  World.tsx into `src/game/scenery.ts`, shared by World (render) and Player
  (collision) so both agree on tree positions. Each scenery item carries a trunk
  radius `r` (banyan 1.4, palm 1.0, fern 0); `COLLIDERS` = the trees.
- Player.tsx does a circular push-out vs COLLIDERS after each move
  (PLAYER_R 0.55): radial resolution, so you slide smoothly around trunks rather
  than sticking. Ferns stay walkable; the central path is already tree-free.
- tsc clean; console clean. Verified collision end-to-end in browser by driving
  the player straight at an isolated tree and sampling min distance to its
  center over the walk: bottomed out at exactly minD (1.95) — never penetrated.
  Core tame loop intact (matong tamed). Pushed to main.

## 2026-06-14 — Day/night cycle (roadmap #4 world richness)
- Checked roadmap #3 (Evolution) first: it's asset-blocked — every species
  folder under public/sprites is just idle/attack/hit/portrait, no evolved-form
  art (the bamut2/bamut3 chains the design doc mentions don't exist in-repo).
  Pivoted to a self-contained #4 slice that needs no new assets.
- New `DayNight.tsx`: a useFrame-driven 120s sun orbit that lerps the sky/fog
  color, sun position/color/intensity, and hemisphere sky/ground colors +
  intensity through noon→dusk→night→dawn. Mutates the scene's own background/fog
  objects in place (no per-frame allocations). Phase-offset so the world loads
  at midday, matching the prior daytime look. GameScene drops its static
  color/fog/lights for `<DayNight/>`.
- tsc clean; console clean; core tame loop verified (party 0→1 via direct tame).
  Two screenshots 45s apart confirm the cycle moves: bright noon → dark, readable
  night (foliage dim, element rings still glow). Pushed to main.

## 2026-06-14 — Persistent battle HP + Rest (roadmap #2)
- Battles now have lasting stakes: damage carries between fights, and the ranch
  is where you recover.
- `battle.ts` — exported `maxHpFor(speciesId, level)`.
- `store.ts` — `TamedMonster.hp` (current HP, init full on tame). `beginBattle`
  starts the lead at its stored HP and refuses if it's fainted (hp 0);
  `endBattle` writes the lead's remaining HP back to the party. New `rest(uid)`
  heals a monster to full.
- `HUD.tsx` — party rows show an HP bar (green/yellow/red) above the bond bar,
  plus a blue Rest button beside Feed (dimmed at full HP).
- QA: tsc clean; in-browser Kancil took a hit to 7 HP, fled, reopened battle
  still at 7 (persisted); a 0-HP lead was blocked ("rest it first"); Rest
  restored full; newly tamed monster starts full; console clean; direct-tame
  loop non-regressed.

## 2026-06-14 — Ranch: bond pays off in battle (roadmap #2, msg #188)
- Made the bond stat matter: a well-fed lead now fights harder, so the Feed
  loop has a real combat payoff.
- `battle.ts` — added `bond` to Combatant + `bondAtkMult(bond)` (1.0→1.2 over
  0..100 bond); `computeDamage` scales the attacker's hit by it. Wilds have
  bond 0 (no bonus).
- `store.ts` — `beginBattle` copies the lead's bond onto the player combatant
  and logs a "+N% damage" note when bond≥50.
- `BattleScreen.tsx` — player fighter name row shows a ♥bond badge.
- QA: tsc clean; in-browser same Kancil(Lv6) vs Bamut Strike hit 32 at bond 0
  vs 43 at bond 100 (+20% on the attack term, shown in log); ♥88 badge rendered;
  console clean; direct-tame loop non-regressed (empty party → tamed Watua).

## 2026-06-13 — Ranch loop, first slice: Feed/bond (roadmap #2)
- Started the raising loop: tamed monsters can now be fed to deepen the bond.
- `store.ts` — new `feed(uid)`: +8 bond (capped 100) and +5 XP via `applyXp`
  (rolls into level-ups). Once bond hits 100 the monster is "already content" —
  no further bond/XP — so the button can't be mashed into infinite levels.
- `HUD.tsx` — each party row gains a pink bond bar (0..100) + a green Feed
  button; row reflowed to flex with the button on the right.
- QA: tsc clean; in-browser fed Kancil 48→56 (others untouched), bond capped at
  100 with the content message, XP accrued; console clean; direct-tame loop
  non-regressed (empty party → tamed Watua → party 1).

## 2026-06-13 — Battle hit juice (roadmap #1 cont.)
- Made trades read as distinct, weighty hits without touching the engine.
- `BattleScreen.tsx` (visual-only) — watches player/enemy HP deltas to pop
  rising/fading "-N" floating damage numbers; the store resolves both hits in
  one update, so the enemy's number shows immediately and the player's
  counter-hit number is staggered ~280ms later. The struck fighter gets a brief
  brightness-flash + shake. New `FloatingDamage` sub-component; sprite wrapped in
  a relative container so numbers position over it.
- No engine/store changes → zero risk to battle math or the tame loop.
- QA: tsc --noEmit clean; in-browser Kancil(Lv9 Forest) vs Bamut(Earth) — Strike
  super-effective 32, Bamut greedily picked Focus Blow (typeless 40) over its
  resisted Strike; floating "-N" nodes confirmed in DOM; console clean;
  direct-tame loop non-regressed (empty party → tamed Watua → party 1).

## 2026-06-13 — Battle move-sets (roadmap #1 cont., msg #182)
- Replaced the single "Attack" with a 2-move kit per monster, making each turn
  a real choice instead of a button-mash.
- `battle.ts` — `Move {name, element|null, power}`; `movesFor(element)` gives a
  typed **Strike** (STAB, power 1.6, uses the element pentagon) and a typeless
  **Focus Blow** (power 2.2, always ×1.0). `computeDamage` now takes a move
  (typeless = no matchup). `pickEnemyMove` = greedy AI (best-damage move).
- `store.ts` — `battleAttack`→`battleMove(moveIndex)`; player picks a move,
  enemy counters with `pickEnemyMove`; tame-fail counter uses it too.
- `BattleScreen.tsx` — one button per move (name + type label) then Tame/Flee.
- Verified in-browser: Forest Kancil vs Spirit Gambang — Strike resisted for 9
  ("not very effective"), typeless Focus Blow hit 21 (2.3× more); Gambang's
  Spirit Strike was super-effective and KO'd the Lv1 Kancil (matchups bite both
  ways). Direct-tame path non-regressed. tsc + console clean. Screenshot
  /tmp/battle-moves.png.

## 2026-06-13 — Battle XP + level-up (roadmap #1 cont., msg #180)
- Winning a battle (enemy faints) or taming a weakened enemy now awards the lead
  party monster XP, which rolls into level-ups that raise its stats next fight.
- `battle.ts` — added `xpForDefeating(enemyLevel)=8+lvl*6`, `xpToNext(level)=
  12+level*8`, and `applyXp(level,xp,gain)` (rolls over multiple level-ups).
- `store.ts` — battleAttack (won branch) + battleTame (success branch) award XP
  to party[0] and log "gained N XP" / "grew to Lv N!".
- `HUD.tsx` — party panel row now shows `Lv · XP x/next · Bond`.
- Verified in-browser: Kancil won vs a Sky Camar (neutral, 16 dmg ×2) → +20 XP →
  Lv 2; then battled+tamed an Earth Watua (super effective) → +26 XP (Lv2, 26/28,
  no level yet — correct) and Watua joined (party→2). Party panel shows XP.
  tsc clean, console clean. Screenshots /tmp/battle-screen.png, /tmp/party-xp.png.

## 2026-06-13 — Turn-based battle scaffold (roadmap #1, msg #178)
- Roster is 12/12 true 3D, so Mahdy green-lit starting the battle system.
  Shipped the first slice: a real, playable weaken→tame battle loop.
- `src/game/battle.ts` — pure engine: element pentagon (Forest→Earth→Sky→Sea→
  Spirit, each ×1.5 vs the next / ×0.67 vs the previous), `makeCombatant` with
  gentle per-level stat scaling, `computeDamage` (atk*1.6 − def*0.8, ×eff),
  `tameChance` that ramps with how weakened the enemy is (up to +0.6 at low HP).
- `store.ts` — new `'battle'` mode + `battle` state; actions beginBattle (lead
  party monster vs the wild; empty party falls back to direct taming),
  battleAttack (player hit → enemy counter), battleTame (weaken-scaled odds; on
  fail the enemy counters), battleFlee, endBattle. Tame success adds to party +
  marks the wild removed.
- `BattleScreen.tsx` — full-screen overlay (enemy top-right, player bottom-left,
  HP bars, 3-line log, Attack/Tame/Flee). Reuses the 2D attack/hit sprite frames
  for a lunge/flinch on each hit. Reached via a "Battle to weaken" button added
  to the taming modal (shows only with ≥1 party monster).
- Verified: tsc clean; in-browser full loop — Forest Kancil vs Earth Bamut read
  "super effective" (14) / Bamut's "not very effective" counter (10), HP bars
  drained, weakened Bamut tamed, party 1→2, wild removed, endBattle→explore with
  message. Direct-tame path non-regressed (party→3). Console clean. Screenshot
  /tmp/battle-screen.png.
- Next slices (see docs/design.md): move-sets, staggered per-hit juice, XP +
  level-up on win, persist party HP, sfx/particles, mobile button sizing.

## 2026-06-13 — Rabuas 3D model (12th & final monster — roster COMPLETE)
- Built `src/models/rabuas.ts` (Rafflesia corpse-flower forest beast) from the
  in-game sprite + blurb: a warty green body (sphere + 12 wart bumps) on four
  stubby vine legs ending in bulbous leaf-pod feet, crowned by a five-petal
  Rafflesia bloom (deep-red cream-spotted petals via CanvasTexture, cupped
  forward) ruffing a toothy green toad-face (big amber eyes + catch-light, heavy
  brow, nostrils, dark grin with cream fangs), plus a couple of curling vine
  tendrils. Idle: breathing + bloom flex/sway + face bob + tendril sway.
  Registered `rabuas`. Hit the TS6133 unused-const trap once more (PETAL only
  used as a hex string inside petalTexture) — removed the const.
- Verified: tsc clean; QA front + 3/4 in model-viewer (bloom reads best at 3/4 —
  the lower petals tuck behind the body in straight-front; face/body/legs read
  well; console clean), restored the viewer import after; Rabuas renders in-world
  at spawn index 11 (wild-rabuas-11, x≈21.7 z≈-12.5) with the proximity prompt;
  full begin→tame→party loop intact (party 0→1 rabuas, mode→explore, nearby
  cleared); console clean. Screenshots /tmp/rabuas-front.png, /tmp/rabuas-34.png.
- **Milestone: all 12 roster monsters are now true from-scratch 3D models, each
  with a subtle idle flourish.** Roster porting (the core of msg #164) is done.

## 2026-06-13 — Watua 3D model (11th monster ported)
- Built `src/models/watua.ts` (treant / root-spirit) from the in-game sprite.
  The roster blurb calls Watua a "stone-spirit," but the art is a wood/root
  treant, so I modelled the sprite: a stout gnarled bark trunk (wood-grain
  CanvasTexture, body+head merged) with bark ridges, a heavy brow (half-torus),
  big amber eyes + catch-light, a bark nose, a hanging beard of root tendrils,
  stubby gnarled root arms + splayed root feet (tapered cones w/ finger nubs),
  moss patches, and a bushy low-poly leaf canopy (icosahedron clumps) crowning
  the head with willow drooping strands. Idle: slow patient sway + canopy
  rustle + beard drift. Registered `watua`. 11/12 roster now true 3D.
- Verified: tsc clean; QA front + 3/4 in model-viewer (face/canopy/arms read
  well; console clean), restored the viewer import after; Watua renders in-world
  at spawn index 10 (wild-watua-10) with the proximity prompt (it blends into
  the foliage, fittingly); full begin→tame→party loop intact (party 0→1,
  mode→explore, tamed flagged, nearby cleared); console clean. Screenshots
  /tmp/watua-front.png, /tmp/watua-34.png, /tmp/watua-world.png.

## 2026-06-13 — Naris 3D model (10th monster ported)
- Built `src/models/naris.ts` (storm-touched coiled naga) from the in-game
  sprite: an olive-green body coiled into two stacked banded toruses (red-brown
  chevron CanvasTexture), cream belly plates up the front, an upright torso
  rising to a frilled dragon head (spike fan) with big green eyes + catch-light,
  snout + nostrils, golden brow scales, a golden storm-smoke wisp (alternating
  partial-torus arcs) curling up from the crown, two little clawed arms resting
  on the coil, and a tapering tail curling up at the back with a golden tuft.
  Idle: breathing + smoke wisp curl/spin + head sway + tail drift. Registered
  `naris`. 10/12 roster now true 3D.
- Verified: tsc clean; QA front + 3/4 in model-viewer (the coiled banded body +
  smoke wisp read great; console clean), restored the viewer import after; Naris
  renders in-world at spawn index 9 (wild-naris-9) with the proximity prompt;
  full begin→tame→party loop intact (party 0→1, mode→explore, tamed flagged,
  nearby cleared); console clean. Screenshots /tmp/naris-front.png,
  /tmp/naris-34.png, /tmp/naris-world.png.

## 2026-06-13 — Ayaka 3D model (9th monster ported)
- Built `src/models/ayaka.ts` (dancing flame-spirit ram-bird) from the in-game
  sprite/portrait: a fluffy golden body with red flame-swirl batik markings
  (CanvasTexture), cream belly, a ruffled tuft skirt round the lower body, big
  curling ram horns (ridged partial-torus), big amber eyes + catch-light, small
  muzzle + nose, fluffy cheeks, a flickering flame crest on the head, a dramatic
  phoenix-like flame tail-plume sweeping up/back, and two orange talon legs.
  Flames are flattened emissive cones arranged in a fan (`flameFan` helper).
  Idle: dancing side-sway + breathing + crest flicker + tail sway. Registered
  `ayaka`. 9/12 roster now true 3D.
- Verified: tsc clean; QA front + 3/4 + back-3/4 in model-viewer (tail-plume
  reads great from behind; console clean), restored the viewer import after;
  Ayaka renders in-world at spawn index 6 (wild-ayaka-6) with the proximity
  prompt; full begin→tame→party loop intact (party 0→1 in 3 tries, mode→explore,
  tamed flagged, nearby cleared); console clean. Screenshots /tmp/ayaka-front.png,
  /tmp/ayaka-back.png, /tmp/ayaka-world.png.

## 2026-06-13 — Babur 3D model (8th monster ported)
- Built `src/models/babur.ts` (winged cloud-piglet) from the in-game sprite. The
  roster blurb calls Babur "tusked and territorial," but the art is a gentle
  sky-touched piglet, so I modelled the sprite: plump cream body with soft blue
  cloud-swirl flank markings (CanvasTexture), pink snout disc + two nostrils,
  rosy cheek blush, big heterochromia eyes (left amber, right blue) + catch-
  light, floppy pink ears, four little hooves, a curly tail, and a pair of
  feathered slate-blue wings. Idle: breathing + gentle wing-flap + tail wiggle.
  Registered `babur`. 8/12 roster now true 3D.
- Wings were the tricky bit: first pass the feathers were narrow flattened cones
  and read as a tiny spiky crest. Broadened each feather (scale 1.4,1,0.55),
  widened the specs, and splayed the fan outward (per-feather rotation.z) so the
  wing reads as a plume fan from the front + 3/4, not just the side.
- Verified: tsc clean; QA front-3/4 + side in model-viewer (console clean),
  restored the viewer import after; Babur renders in-world at spawn index 7
  (wild-babur-7) with the proximity prompt; full begin→tame→party loop intact
  (party 0→1 in 2 tries, mode→explore, tamed flagged, nearby cleared); console
  clean. Screenshots /tmp/babur-v3-34.png, /tmp/babur-world.png.

## 2026-06-13 — Kepiting 3D model (7th monster ported)
- Built `src/models/kepiting.ts` (armoured reef crab) from the in-game sprite
  (no ref sheet): a wide domed carapace with a mottled crusty CanvasTexture +
  cream barnacle freckles, a lighter tan belly-plate with two mask dimples,
  cream barnacle nodules crusting the rim, a pink-red branching coral crown on
  top, two black eyes (golden rings + catch-light) on short eyestalks, two big
  pincer claws (segmented arms + open jaws with pink inner edges, barnacle-
  crusted palms), and three pairs of segmented walking legs. Idle: gentle
  breathing + claws slowly open/close. Registered `kepiting`.
- First pass the coral crown was a tiny bump; enlarged its branches/bulbs +
  added side nubs so it reads as a proper reef fan like the sprite.
- Verified: tsc clean; QA front + 3/4 in model-viewer (console clean), restored
  the viewer import after; Kepiting renders grounded in-world with the proximity
  prompt; full begin→tame→party loop intact (party 0→1, mode→explore, tamed
  hidden, nearby cleared). Screenshots /tmp/kepiting-v2.png, /tmp/kepiting-world.png.
  7/12 roster now true 3D.

## 2026-06-13 — Gambang 3D model (6th monster ported)
- Built `src/models/gambang.ts` (flower-spirit bird) from the in-game sprite (no
  ref sheet): a chibi bird whose plump body is a layered bloom of coral/peach
  petals (four overlapping rings of flattened spheres, lower rows splayed out),
  a petal ruff radiating around the face, a crown of upright petals topped by
  golden flower-buds, big teal eyes + catch-light, a small hooked golden beak,
  green leaf wings + a fanned leaf tail, and golden talon legs. Idle: gentle
  breathing + crown-bud sway + soft wing flutter. Registered `gambang`.
- Gotcha: first pass the petals came out as tiny nubs — I'd scaled them off a
  `SphereGeometry(0.1)` base, so the real petals were ~2cm. Rebuilt `petal()` on
  a `SphereGeometry(0.5)` base sized in true world units; body now reads as an
  artichoke-like bloom.
- Verified: tsc clean; QA front + 3/4 in model-viewer (no errors), restored the
  viewer import after; Gambang renders grounded in-world with the proximity
  prompt; full begin→tame→party loop intact (party 0→1, mode→explore, tamed
  hidden, nearby cleared); console clean. Screenshots /tmp/gambang-front.png,
  /tmp/gambang-world.png. 6/12 roster now true 3D.

## 2026-06-13 — Bamut 3D model (5th monster ported)
- Built `src/models/bamut.ts` (mossy boar earth-beast) from the in-game sprite
  (no ref sheet): stocky front-heavy quadruped with a mottled moss CanvasTexture
  hide, shoulder hump, tan snout barrel + nose pad with nostrils, big amber
  eyes, upturned cream tusks, pointed ears, dark hooves, a curly tail, and red
  mushrooms + a fern sprig sprouting from its back. Idle: heavy breathing +
  tail curl-wiggle. Registered `bamut`.
- Verified: tsc clean; QA 3/4 + back in model-viewer (no errors); Bamut renders
  grounded in-world with the proximity prompt; full begin→tame→party loop intact
  (party 0→1, mode→explore, tamed hidden, nearby cleared). Screenshots
  /tmp/bamut-34.png, /tmp/bamut-back.png. 5/12 roster now true 3D.

## 2026-06-13 — Dugang 3D model (4th monster ported)
- Built `src/models/dugang.ts` (dugong/manatee sea-spirit) from the in-game
  sprite (no ref sheet): plump blue-grey body + lighter belly, broad whiskered
  snout with nostrils, big pale-blue eyes, side flippers, tail fluke, a green
  seaweed necklace draped across the chest with a pale scallop-shell pendant,
  and turquoise water-swirl wisps (partial-torus arcs) rising at its sides.
  Idle flourish: slow breathing + the wisps rise and sway. Registered `dugang`.
- Necklace/pendant first rendered buried inside the body sphere; moved them to a
  frontal arc sitting proud of the surface (beads sweep across the front only,
  dipping in the middle; shell hangs at centre).
- Verified: tsc clean; QA 3/4 in model-viewer (no errors); Dugang renders
  grounded in-world with the proximity prompt; full begin→tame→party loop intact
  (party 0→1, mode→explore, tamed hidden, nearby cleared). Screenshots
  /tmp/dugang-v2.png, /tmp/dugang-world.png. 4/12 roster now true 3D.

## 2026-06-13 — Matong 3D model (3rd monster ported)
- Built `src/models/matong.ts` (striped marsupial-tiger forest guardian) from
  the in-game sprite (no ref sheet exists): vibrant orange fur banded with black
  tiger stripes via a CanvasTexture, cream chest/belly, big triangular ears,
  large amber eyes + catch-light, dark nose, short arms with cream paws, stubby
  feet, a banded tapered tail, and a marsupial belly-pouch with a green fern
  sprig. Idle flourish: gentle tail-sway + slow breathing. Registered `matong`.
- Gotcha fixed: a mapped material multiplies its base color by the texture, so
  `mat(FUR, {map})` darkened orange×orange into maroon — set mapped meshes to
  `mat(0xffffff, {map})` so the stripe texture shows true.
- Verified: tsc clean; QA 3/4 + side in model-viewer (no errors); Matong renders
  grounded in-world with the proximity prompt; full begin→tame→party loop intact
  (party 0→1, mode→explore, tamed hidden, nearby cleared). Screenshots
  /tmp/matong-v2.png, /tmp/matong-world.png.

## 2026-06-13 — per-creature idle hook + Camar wing-flap
- Added a reusable per-creature idle-animation hook: a builder may set
  `group.userData.idle = (t) => {...}` referencing its own sub-meshes;
  `MonsterModel` calls it each frame via `useFrame`. Keeps per-species motion
  inside the builder instead of the renderer.
- Camar now slow-flaps its wings at rest: captured `wingR`/`wingL` and drive
  their `rotation.z`/`.x` from `sin(t*2.4)`. Reads as a hovering storm-gull.
- Verified: tsc clean; console clean; Camar renders in-world with the proximity
  prompt; full begin→tame→party loop intact (party 0→1, mode→explore, tamed
  hidden, nearby cleared). Note: R3F v8 `canvas.__r3f` is unreadable here, so the
  flap is confirmed by clean typecheck + the same useFrame path that already
  drives the working bob/face-player. Screenshot /tmp/camar-flap-3.png.

## 2026-06-13 — wild monsters turn to face the player
- `WildMonster.useFrame` now smoothly rotates the group to face the player when
  within ~20u (shortest-path angle lerp, frame-rate independent). Idle bob is
  gentler at rest and livelier within tame range. Reusable for every 3D model;
  harmless for billboards (Sprites always face the camera) and the flat element
  ring (rotationally symmetric, stays flat).
- Verified: tsc clean; Camar visibly orients toward the trainer (side-view
  shot /tmp/camar-face-profile.png); no console errors; begin→tame→party still
  works (party=1, explore, nearby cleared).

## 2026-06-13 — Camar storm-gull 3D model (2nd monster ported)
- Built `src/models/camar.ts` (Camar Badai): slate body + white chest, hooked
  golden beak, golden eyes, blue-tipped spiky crest, swept blade-wings with
  electric-blue lightning-streak feathers, turquoise throat gem, pennant tail,
  talon feet. Registered `camar` in the model registry.
- Note: only kancil + camar have BOTH a ref sheet and a wild-spawn slot. Sheet-
  only species (penyu/ubur/…) need a roster slot + taming-modal portrait before
  they can be added — captured in docs/models.md Next. (Built a penyu.ts this
  run, then removed it since it had nowhere to render + no modal portrait.)
- Verified: tsc clean; QA turntable 3/4 + back in model-viewer (no errors);
  Camar renders grounded in-world; drove begin→tame→party (party=1, explore,
  nearby cleared). Screenshots /tmp/camar-34.png, /tmp/camar-world2.png.

## 2026-06-13 — model registry: 3D Kancil renders in the world
- Added `src/models/registry.ts` (species id → builder, `hasModel`) and
  `src/components/MonsterModel.tsx` (builds mesh, normalises to world height via
  Box3, shadows, `<primitive>`). `WildMonster` now renders the 3D model when a
  builder exists, else falls back to the 2D billboard. Kancil is the first ported.
- Exposed `cameraState` on `window.__realm` for QA orbit control.
- Verified: tsc clean; Kancil mesh renders grounded in-world, no console errors;
  proximity prompt fires; drove begin→tame→party (party=1, mode back to explore,
  nearby cleared — race fix holds). Screenshot /tmp/realm-kancil-clear.png.

## 2026-06-13 — Kancil v1 refine + image-to-3D decision (msg #138)
- Mahdy: no paid/credit-gated image-to-3D generators. All reachable ones (Meshy/
  Tripo) gate behind small free caps; open-source (TripoSR/InstantMesh/Hunyuan3D)
  need a GPU we don't have. Decision: every monster is hand-built in Three.js
  from the reference sheets. Recorded in docs/models.md.
- Refined `src/models/kancil.ts` toward the ref sheet's chibi look: bigger
  rounded head, large amber eyes (+catch-light), big cream-lined leaf ears,
  plump bean body sitting low, cream muzzle/belly, batik on flank + rump,
  short legs tucked under the body (no longer floating stilts), splayed feet.
- tsc clean; QA turntable front + 3/4 in model-viewer, no console errors.
  Screenshots /tmp/kancil-v1-front.png, /tmp/kancil-v1-34.png (sent).

## 2026-06-13 — pivot to true 3D models (msg #134)
- Mahdy: make assets real 3D, built from scratch in Three.js, using our
  character reference sheets (turnaround sheets in nusantara-monster/assets/raw).
- Built first from-scratch model: `src/models/kancil.ts` (Kancil Emas — gold
  coat, batik flank, cream-lined ears, amber eyes, black hooves, gold anklet)
  + a turntable viewer (`model-viewer.html` / `src/model-viewer.ts`).
- v0 model is recognisable but rough (legs/proportions need refining). tsc clean,
  rendered + screenshot in browser. Set this as roadmap item #0; loop will refine
  then build out the roster. See docs/models.md.

## 2026-06-13 — v0 created & shipped
- Proved feasibility first with a Three.js HD-2D POC (separate `nusantara-3d/`):
  Nusantara sprites as billboards in a 3D world. Screenshot sent, approved.
- Scaffolded the real game in React-three-fiber per Mahdy's request (msg #130).
- Built: 3D overworld (grass/path/scenery), follow camera + drag-orbit, player
  with directional walk frames, 12-monster wild roster (bobbing billboards +
  element rings), proximity taming prompt, taming modal w/ species stats, and a
  party panel. Zustand store; rarity-scaled taming odds.
- Fixed a one-frame race where a just-tamed monster re-flagged itself "nearby"
  (WildMonster.useFrame now reads live `tamedWildIds`).
- `tsc --noEmit` clean. Verified in agent-browser: render OK, no console errors,
  full explore→approach→E→tame→party loop works.
- Created public repo github.com/faisalmahdy/nusantara-realm; pushed v0 (62482d1).
- Scaffolded indexed docs (index/log/docs) per the standing convention.
- Pending: set up the hourly improvement loop; begin roadmap item #1 (battle).
