# Log — Nusantara Realm

## 2026-06-13 — v0 created & shipped
- Proved feasibility first with a Three.js HD-2D POC (separate `nusantara-3d/`):
  Nusantara sprites as billboards in a 3D world. Screenshot sent, approved.
- Scaffolded the real game in React-three-fiber per Mahdy's request (msg #130).
- Built: 3D overworld (grass/path/scenery), follow camera + drag-orbit, player
  with directional walk frames, 12-monster wild roster (bobbing billboards +
  element rings), proximity taming prompt, taming modal w/ species stats, and a
  party panel. Zustand store; rarity-scaled taming odds.
- Fixed a one-frame race where a just-tamed monster re-flagged itself "nearby"
  (WildMonster.useFrame now reads live `tamedWildIds`).
- `tsc --noEmit` clean. Verified in agent-browser: render OK, no console errors,
  full explore→approach→E→tame→party loop works.
- Created public repo github.com/faisalmahdy/nusantara-realm; pushed v0 (62482d1).
- Scaffolded indexed docs (index/log/docs) per the standing convention.
- Pending: set up the hourly improvement loop; begin roadmap item #1 (battle).
